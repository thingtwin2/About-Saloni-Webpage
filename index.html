		<p><font size="5pt"> This is my own digital painting. I wrote the code for it with JavaScript, in an environment called Processing JS by Khan Academy. My partner for this project was Melody,and this was done during week two. This artwork was inspired by the painter Jackson Pollock, who drew lots of abstract paintings. You can move the mouse around the screen of the image, and you will be able to draw on the screen too.This was one of my favorite Girls Who Code projects. If you like to see the code for this masterpiece, click on the link below this. </font></p>

		<p><font size="5pt"> This project is called Fish Tank. For this project I worked with Melody. We thought this was the hardest project to complete out of the three we did in week two. This project was also done in Porocessing JS. It was really hard to do, because we had to make fish, and the octopus, and then we had to get them to move. After we got them moving, we couldn't get the fish to travel of the screen and then reappear. Though in the end we got everything to work, and it looks great.</font></p>

		<p> <font size="5pt">This was the last assignment that was done during week 2 of GWC. For this project, I also worked with Melody. This one was not, as hard as the fish tank. This project along with the fish tank, required us to use classes in our code. It was really fun, because it actually worked and then we had time to go back and add more details to the project.</font></p>

		<p> <font size="5pt">This assignment was completed during week one at GWC. The object of this game, is the keep the ball from touching the ground, the user has to use the mouse to move the carpet, to bump the ball into the air. During the first week, we used Scratch to code. My partner for this week was Jasmine. When we were doing this project during the first week, we thought this was soo hard. Later we learned that more challenging assignments we coming. In the end this was my favorite assignment, from the scratch unit, because it was the most simple. In Scratch there is button at the top of the screen, that allows you to publish your code, to the Scratch.mit website. If published on the website, then other can see your code, and edit it there to make it better. To visit the website, and see the code for this assignment click the link below.  </font></p>

		<p><font size="5pt"> This is a game made in Scratch, during week two of GWC. It was the hardest to code, because it was so complicated. The puropse of the game is to keep rolling the dice as many times as you want, until one player gets 25 points. This game required lots of coding, but was really fun to play after we got it to work. You can play the game below by clicking the link.  </font></p>

		<p> <font size="5pt">This is an MP3 player, that actually does work. It plays songs that Jasmine and I have composed. This was kinda challenging because, we had to make our own songs. To listen to our great songs, click the link below. </font></p>

		<p> <font size="5pt"> This assignment was done in week two of GWC.For this project, I worked with Molly M. It was really fun to do this assignment, because once we found the mistake in our code, it worked perfectly. The way this works is, at first the user enters the color they would like to find, and then the scribbler robots turns and finds that color, by taking pictures with the camera on the front of it, and when it identifies the color, it moves toward it. This project was coded in Python. Originally this project was done with the emulator, an online version of the scribbler robots. On the emulator the code worked perfectly, and every time the scribbler robot found the right color blob. Then we tried using the sensors on the real life scribbler robots, to mimic the same process. But the camera is not very good at identifying the correct colors. So instead of finding a certain color, the robot find an object within a certain distance. We called this "Find the Box". To watch the robot in action click the link below.</font></p>

		<p> <font size="5pt">This was the most fun assignment, because we coded, the robots to dance to a song. This project was done during week two, while I worked with Molly M., it was our favorite thing to do during week two. Click the link below to see the scribbler robot dancing. </font></p>
